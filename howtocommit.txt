The current active and default branch is “develop”. Make sure all your feature/bug fix code commits be made to this branch and submitted via a pull request. 

At this moment, we need 1 reviewer to review your code. This number could be changed in future.

Following is a quick guide on code commits.

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MeiwenLi/hapue.git
1. Create your own branch from “develop” and change your working branch to it.
git branch reporter
git branch
git checkout reporter
    Make sure your code change will be on the latest code base
git pull 
  (make code change) 

add changes 
changes from particular file
git add <file>  (eg.  git add howtocommit.txt)
changes from all tracked and untracked files
git add -A 
remove the added file to be changed
git reset HEAD <file>… (eg.  git reset HEAD src/.DS_Store)

Please do not change existing dependencies version in POM.xml but only add new ones if needed


confirm the changes you want to make
git status


1. Commit and push your code to your own branch with descriptions including purpose, risk of your set of code.
git commit -m "test the repository branches setting”

To remove the last commit from git, you can simply run git reset --hard HEAD^ If you are removing multiple commits from the top, you can run git reset --hard HEAD~2 to remove the last two commits.

1. make a pull request and require a code review from the GitHub website (you might want to ping the people to help you review code)
2. merge the code to “develop” branch when you get review approval
